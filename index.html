      <p>Since 4, I have been obsessed with baking. I used to sit in my tiny wooden rocking chair, practically 2 feet from the screen, entranced as Julie Child taught me my first lessons. While other people were watching Rugrats, I was learning how to stick my hand up a turkey’s ass. From then on, Thanksgiving and Christmas were times I looked forward too, so I could help my mom bake the pecan and pumpkin pies. I only dropped one.
      Throughout high school, my interest turned to cakes, and I would shape baked goods into guitars for my musically inclined friends, and skateboards for the punks. It was more than a hobby, it was a passion. So, after senior year, I decided to continue my culinary interest, and attend school, focusing on pastry. At the same time, I was working as a chocolatier for a local New Orleans candy store. I spent 6 years in the chocolate kitchen, learning caramels, sugar candies, fudges, and of course chocolate. Later, getting back into cakes, I staged under Tariq Hannah, world renowned head chef of Sucre. He taught me a few pointers to get my cake baking skills more precise. But where it all started, seems to be where it is leading. Living in Portland, my roommate would pay me to bake him his favorite dish: chicken pot pie. I perfected my recipe while also making a little “dough”. Once I moved back to New Orleans, I couldn’t get enough, and new I had more recipes up my sleeve to deliver to people just like him. People who loved a good home cooked meal that they couldn’t get anywhere else, like their grandma used to make, delivered right to their door.</p>
